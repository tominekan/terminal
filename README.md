# Tomi's Terminal

This is a redesign of my personal website as a terminal emulator. It's pretty unique and works like any unix based command line interface

*Future Ideas/Plans*
- [ ] Integrate Spotify API with this website, add what I'm currently listening to
- [x] Update website when I get into college
- [ ] Add more detail in the personal information section, looks pretty spartan ngl
- [x] Create new "file system" class for extensive refactoring (reduce code repitition)
- [x] Make the directory system less trivial lol, need to get rid of repeating code
- [ ] Add some fun little easter eggs
- [ ] Add more terminal functionality like command line flags (maybe waay later down the line)
