# Tomi's Terminal

This is a redesign of my personal website as a terminal emulator. It's pretty unique and works like any unix based command line interface

*Future Ideas/Plans*
- [ ] Integrate Spotify API with this website, add what I'm currently listening to
- [ ] Update website when I get into college
- [ ] Add more detail in the personal information section, looks pretty spartan ngl
- [ ] Create new "file system" class for extensive refactoring (reduce code repitition)
- [ ] Make the directory system less trivial lol, need to get rid of repeating code

## Note: 
I'm going to completely rework my re-implementation of the file system structure. Now that I've taken a proper DSA course, I should probably implement the filesystem as a tree. I can't believe I tried some other weird implementation before, it's so much simpler using a tree-like structure lol.
