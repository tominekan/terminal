# Tomi's Terminal

This is a redesign of my personal website as a terminal emulator. It's pretty unique and works like any unix based command line interface

*Future Ideas/Plans*
- [ ] Integrate Spotify API with this website, add what I'm currently listening to
- [ ] Update website when I get into college
- [ ] Add more detail in the personal information section, looks pretty spar ngl
